    <h3 id="the-site-is-interactive">the Site is Interactive</h3><p>Go ahead and change the words below:</p><pre><code class="klipse-cljs nohighlight">"Make the wrong thing hard and the right thing easy, every other
plan will fail under stress."
</code></pre><p>This presentation is interactive. So you can try out the code, or modify it. Have Fun!</p><p>If you want a better online editor go <a href="http://clojurescript.io/">here</a>. If you get
stuck on something related to Clojure try the Clorian Slack #Beginners channel.</p><h3 id="on-discussing-programming-languages">On discussing Programming languages</h3><p>I was discussing programming languages on the Michigan Devs slack and someone said
something very profound on the topic of discussing programming languages:</p><blockquote><p>I believe the human tendency is to distill an important yet complex topic down
to simple practical conclusions, and become emotionally attached to those
conclusions.  This is necessary in order to make confident high-level decisions
on what to do about the topic within the contexts that we live, and defend
those decisions later.  As a result, perhaps the hardest thing to find in
programming literature and communities are perspectives and ideas that are both
reasonably objective and still useful within any single context.  The diversity
in programming environments and business contexts is so vast, that it is indeed
very challenging to make any statement of wisdom that is broadly applicable.  I
think high-level discussions about programming languages and paradigms are very
clear examples of this unfortunate dynamic.</p></blockquote><ul><li>Jerry Wiltse</li></ul><p>I think Jerry has touched on something very important, that many of our
decisions are made out of necessity. Many factors play into our choice of programming
language:</p><ul><li>prior knowledge</li><li>the task at hand</li><li>hiring power</li></ul><p>Are just some of the considerations for what the "best language" is. So
in reality, "best" is high subjective. So rather then argue about which
language is best, i would rather talk about why I enjoy Clojure.</p><h1 id="why-i-enjoy-clojure">Why I enjoy Clojure</h1><img src="/img/Clojure_logo.svg" /><p>I enjoy Clojure because it helps me keep things simple.</p><h2 id="what-is-simple">What is simple?</h2><p>There are a couple definitions but the one i like the most is:</p><blockquote><p>Not Compounded</p></blockquote><p>Compounded should summon images like this:</p><img src="/img/compound.gif" /><p>Of something entailed and intertwined, think "spaghetti code". You should
have a slightly bad taste in your mouth.</p><h2 id="what-isnt-simple-but-still-valuable">what isn't simple? (but still valuable)</h2><ul><li>Convenience - its easy to get up and going (Python is installed on computers)</li><li>Beginner-friendliness - warm and friendly (ruby works very hard at this)</li><li>Ease - is relative, for Lebrone James Dunking is easy</li><li>Familiarity - important for adaption</li><li>Less steps - less isn't necessary better if it means mushing things together which can lead to confusion.</li></ul><h2 id="why-is-simple-valuable">Why is Simple valuable?</h2><blockquote><p>It can scarcely be denied that the supreme goal of all theory is to make the
irreducible basic elements as simple and as few as possible without having to
surrender the adequate representation of a single datum of experience.</p></blockquote><p>Which is often paraphrased as:</p><blockquote><p>Everything should be made as simple as possible, but no simpler.</p></blockquote><ul><li>Albert Einstein</li></ul><h2 id="how-clojure-enables-simplicity">How Clojure enables Simplicity:</h2><ul><li>Simplicity of Syntax</li><li>Simplicity of Protocols</li><li>Simplicity of Values and Reference</li></ul><p>#Syntax</p><h2 id="hello-world-in-clojure">Hello World in Clojure:</h2><pre><code class="klipse-cljs nohighlight">"Hello World"
</code></pre><p>This is a full program. It has complied just for your viewing pleasure. This is possible because
everything is Data. What we have below is a hash-map <code>{}</code>:</p><h2 id="simple-primitives">Simple Primitives</h2><p>There are a small set of pieces from which we construct things in Clojure.
These are displayed below in a map:</p><pre><code class="klipse-cljs nohighlight">{
 :string "hello"
 :character \f
 :integer 42
 :floating-point 3.14
 :boolean true
 :symbol +
 :keyword [:foo ::foo]
 }
</code></pre><p>Notice the symbol is displayed as the javascript function it represents.</p><p>You might be curious about keywords. Keywords are names and look themselves up in maps.
In this, and a couple other ways, they are different from Strings.</p><p>You can also discover the type of something by doing asking for it using the <code>type</code> function.</p><pre><code class="klipse-cljs nohighlight">(type ::test)
</code></pre><p>Keywords with Two colons means its a fully qualified keyword (its unique in the whole wide world):</p><pre><code class="klipse-cljs nohighlight">::test
</code></pre><p>As opposed to a keyword with one colon, which you will notice doesn't have the full namespace <code>clj.user</code></p><pre><code class="klipse-cljs nohighlight">:test
</code></pre><h2 id="collections">Collections</h2><p>Here is a map of the collection types, one of which is a map. (how meta)</p><pre><code class="klipse-cljs nohighlight">{:list '(1 2 3)
 :vector [1 2 3]
 :map {:a 1 :b 2 :c 3}
}
</code></pre><p>The <code>'</code> on the list might have caught your eye. This tells the
clojure to not evaluate the list. Why is that problem? Good question!
Lets see...</p><pre><code class="klipse-cljs nohighlight">(1 2 3)
</code></pre><p>If you scroll through that error message you will see;</p><blockquote><p>TypeError: 1 is not a function</p></blockquote><p>In Clojure the first argument to a list needs to be a function:</p><pre><code class="klipse-cljs nohighlight">(+ 1 2 3)
</code></pre><h2 id="function-call-semantics">Function call semantics</h2><img src="/img/language-semantics.jpg" /><h2 id="you-know-now-all-the-syntax-of-clojure">You know now all the syntax of Clojure</h2><p>Yes. Really. Clojure programs are written using those just those primitives
and that one simple rule <i>language designers dont want you to know about</i>.</p><h3 id="clojure-functions">Clojure Functions</h3><p>Lets look at a function that makes other functions <code>defn</code> which you can
read as "define function".</p><pre><code class="klipse-cljs nohighlight">(defn greet
  "returns a friendly greeting"
  [your-name]
  (str "Hello, " your-name))
</code></pre><p>Go ahead and try it out:</p><pre><code class="klipse-cljs nohighlight">(greet "Chris Broski, the one true Chris!!!")
</code></pre><p>Lets look at this in detail:</p><img src="/img/clojure-functions.jpg" /><p>So you can see that we built this function using our core primitives:</p><img src="/img/clojure-function-types.jpg" /><h1 id="macros">Macros</h1><p>Macros allow you to extend the language. This means you can make a DSL quite easily.</p><pre><code class="klipse-cljs nohighlight">;; ignore the namespace
(ns my.m$macros)

(defmacro backwards
  [form]
  (reverse form))
</code></pre><pre><code class="klipse-cljs nohighlight">(my.m/backwards (" backwards" " am" "I" str))
</code></pre><p>This macro <code>backwards</code> intercepted the form <code>(" backwards" " am" "I" str)</code> and reversed it
to  <code>(str "I" "am " "backwards")</code> before that form evaluated. This is important, because
as we discussed The operator must be the first thing in the form/list. See what happens without the macro?</p><pre><code class="klipse-cljs nohighlight">(" backwards" " am" "I" str)
</code></pre><p>This is made possible because Clojure is a Lisp and so you as a programer can manipulate both
the regular form (what any language can do) but also the form created the parser and lexer:</p><img src="/img/lisp-eval.png" /><p>Generally speaking, you should <em>strongly</em> prefer functions over macros.
However their are times when using a macro can greatly simplify a problem. Here is a <a href="http://www.lispcast.com/when-to-use-a-macro">blog
post</a> about when to use macros if
you want to learn more. But the three main situations are:</p><ul><li>Gaining control over the control structure (we demoed this above)</li><li>Performing compile-time computation</li><li>Providing custom syntax</li></ul><h2 id="simplicity-of-syntax-recap">Simplicity of Syntax recap:</h2><ul><li><p>Not much syntax</p><ul><li>Personal I have noticed I can do far less with more in langauges like Ruby and Python. Whose constructs seem more limited, and harder to remember</li></ul></li><li><p>Not much about ordering</p><ul><li>This goes in the middle, this goes at the top, etc..</li></ul></li><li><p>A preference for re-using the same data structures.</p><ul><li>This is hard to show the benefit from in a small example. It comes from their being a very rich library of functions
in clojure that can work against these data structures, which allows the developer to focus on learning how to manipulate data.</li></ul></li><li><p>Macros allowing for powerful language manipulation.</p></li></ul><h3 id="simplicity-in-protocols">Simplicity in Protocols</h3><p>A Protocol is :</p><blockquote><p>a set of rules governing the exchange or transmission of data between two services.</p></blockquote><p>Lets work through a quick example. Say we have three Reversible things.</p><img src="/img/object-design-1.jpg" /><p>In this case our protocol is the Ability to reverse things and we need a way set of rules to govern
how different services/types are reversed.</p><p>How would i go about modeling this in a OO language?
Possible something like this:</p><img src="/img/object-design-2.jpg" /><p>The Interface abstraction in Java would Interface.
The Implementation abstraction in Java would be a Class.</p><p>However it seems like something isn't labeled on our Model, the arrows to and from our interface:</p><img src="/img/object-design-3.jpg" /><p>What is that in Java? Or Ruby? Or javascript?  It's an interesting question, and will
go into it more an just a bit.</p><p>In java this often times it involves some sort of design pattern.
For instance, I believe the Adaptor pattern might help:</p><p>&lt;img src="/img/ClassAdapter.png"</p><blockquote><p>Class Adapter pattern</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>This adapter pattern uses multiple polymorphic interfaces implementing or
inheriting both the interface that is expected and the interface that is
pre-existing. It is typical for the expected interface to be created as a
pure interface class, especially in languages such as Java (before jdk 1.8)
that do not support multiple inheritance of classes.[1]</p></blockquote><p>If were in a dynamic language like Ruby and Python we might be able to monkey
patch, but the patchs might overlap and cause problems.</p><h3 id="how-do-we-simplify-this">How do we simplify this?</h3><p>To make something Simpler, identify the part of the Model that has no
specification and give it one. Put another way, if your
Model has more things then names, its compounded to some degree.</p><p>In Clojure(script) we have an abstraction to extend a protocol, its simple ccalled <code>extend-protocal</code>.</p><h3 id="extending-protocals">Extending protocals</h3><pre><code class="klipse-cljs nohighlight">(defrecord ReversibleTie [a b])

(extend-protocol IReversible
              ReversibleTie
              (^clj -rseq [tie] (-&gt;ReversibleTie (:b tie) (:a tie)))
              js/String
              (^clj -rseq [s] (str "We Welcome all your " s)))
</code></pre><p>Thats complaining probably because were extending an existing type with an existing method, which isn't a great idea...</p><p>So we make a tie, by instantiating a record, which at this stage you can think of
like a ordered map with required keys:</p><pre><code class="klipse-cljs nohighlight">(map-&gt;ReversibleTie {:a "a" :b "b"})
</code></pre><p>Now reverse it:</p><pre><code class="klipse-cljs nohighlight">(reverse
 (map-&gt;ReversibleTie {:a "a" :b "b"}))
</code></pre><p>And notice we can also "reverse" a String:</p><pre><code class="klipse-cljs nohighlight">(reverse "WhiffleCakes")
</code></pre><h3 id="polymorhism-in-clojure">Polymorhism in Clojure</h3><p>What we just learned was Polymorhism in Clojure. How to have one function
<code>reverse</code> behave differently on different types. Unlike in most OO langauges we
have an additional abstraction <code>extend</code> which allows us to extend existing classes.</p><p>What we avoided by having this:</p><ul><li>adapter pattern</li><li>wrapper pattern</li><li>translator pattern</li><li>monkey patching</li><li>StringUtils</li></ul><h2 id="simplicity-in-values-and-references">Simplicity in values and references</h2><p>Lets say we want to model me at my highschool weight:</p><img src="/img/clojure-simple-by-design-27-638.jpg" /><p>And the transition to my current weight...</p><img src="/img/clojure-simple-by-design-29-638.jpg" /><p>In OO languages we might do something like this.</p><img src="/img/clojure-simple-by-design-30.png" /><p>These question marks represent the idea that typically we only
capture the most current value of something. So in terms of labeling things
were forced to re-use an idea and leave others blank.</p><h3 id="simplify-by-addressing-the-missing-pieces">Simplify by addressing the missing pieces:</h3><img src="/img/clojure-simple-by-design-32-638.jpg" /><p>Clojure has a extremely rich set of built in tools to handle
state management when its really necessary. Here were going to use
whats called an atom.</p><pre><code class="klipse-cljs nohighlight">(defprotocol Nachos
 (yum [_] "eat some nachos"))

 (defrecord Person [name lbs]
   Nachos
  (yum [person]
        (update-in person [:lbs] + 2)))

(def me (atom (-&gt;Person "Drew" 182)))

(def me-before @me)

(swap! me yum)

(def me-after @me)

me-after
</code></pre><p>Were able to isolate the functional part of the program..</p><img src="/img/clojure-simple-by-design-34-638.jpg" /><p>From the stateful part which requires update semantics</p><img src="/img/clojure-simple-by-design-35-638.jpg" /><p>And  effectively model the transition.</p><img src="/img/clojure-simple-by-design-36-638.jpg" /><p>The key element here isn't that we captured before and after,
we could do that easily with varibles in most languages. The
key is that Atom is designed to work intelligently if their
are multiple threads accessing that information.</p><p>When we call Swap on an atom, if that atom has been changed by the time
were done applying the function to it, then we re-try with the new value:</p><img src="/img/atom-swap.png" /><p>###Complexies avoided:</p><ul><li>Lack of temporal reasoning</li><li>Single threaded program</li><li>Locking</li><li>Defensive copying</li><li>Setter methods</li><li>Str vs StringBuilder vs StringBuffer</li></ul><p>And its important to note that this problems can easily become combinatorial,
that is, compound with each other.</p><h3 id="this-is-all-built-into-clojure">This is all built into clojure.</h3><p>So what jumps out at you when look at these various solutions to the dinning
philosphers problems?</p><ul><li><a href="https://rosettacode.org/wiki/Dining_philosophers#Java">java</a></li><li><a href="https://rosettacode.org/wiki/Dining_philosophers#Clojure">clojure</a></li><li><a href="https://rosettacode.org/wiki/Dining_philosophers#Ruby">ruby</a></li></ul><p>Clojure doesn't need any import statements! I'm not arguing this is better,
but it's an important point that Concurrency was built into
Clojure from the <a href="https://clojure.org/about/state">start</a>.</p><h3 id="benefits-of-clojure">Benefits of clojure</h3><p>So we have talked about how clojure enables simplify but its also useful
to frame clojure in terms of what it enables you todo. Will look at some
examples and see how they match to some high level themes:</p><ul><li><b>Concision</b> : shorter programs, which all things equal, is good</li><li>Generality       : can handle a number of different situations</li><li>Robustness       : program correctness (no surprises)</li><li>Agility          : how easy it is to change a program.</li></ul><p>To understand how Clojure enables concision lets look at a simple of
a function <code>indexOfAny</code> that find the index of the first character in
a string given a set of strings. Here is the specification:</p><img src="/img/clojure-simple-by-design-41-638.jpg" /><p>Were going to walk this code through a series of transformations in order
to make it into a clojure program.</p><img src="/img/clojure-simple-by-design-42-638.jpg" /><p>First we remove the corner cases, mainly returning -1 (which doesn't mean anything)
and instead returning an empty list (which will show later):</p><img src="/img/clojure-simple-by-design-43-638.jpg" /><p>Then we remove the type declarations:
<img src="/img/clojure-simple-by-design-44-638.jpg" /></p><p>Leverage the when function:</p><img src="/img/clojure-simple-by-design-45-638.jpg" /><p>Leverage list comprehension:</p><img src="/img/clojure-simple-by-design-46-638.jpg" /><p>Use clojure syntax:</p><img src="/img/clojure-simple-by-design-47-638.jpg" /><p>Looks like left ouf the implementation of indexed (unless im missing a built in function somewhere...)</p><pre><code class="klipse-cljs nohighlight">(defn indexed [coll]
  (map-indexed (fn [idx itm] [idx itm]) coll))

(defn index-filter [pred coll]
    (for [[idx elt] (indexed coll)  :when (pred elt)] idx))
</code></pre><h3 id="benefits-of-clojure-1">Benefits of clojure</h3><ul><li>concision</li><li><b>generality</b></li><li>robustness</li><li>agility</li></ul><img src="/img/clojure-simple-by-design-49-638.jpg" /><p>get indexs of heads in a stream of coin clips...</p><pre><code class="klipse-cljs nohighlight">(index-filter #{:h}
  [:t :h :t :h :t :h :h :t :t :t])
</code></pre><p>Or maybe the get the index of any fibonaccis number that is less then 10.</p><p>Make a quick fib generator:</p><pre><code class="klipse-cljs nohighlight">(def fib-seq
  ((fn rfib [a b]
     (lazy-seq (cons a (rfib b (+ a b)))))
   0 1))

(take 20 fib-seq)
</code></pre><p>Find the index of those less then 10</p><pre><code class="klipse-cljs nohighlight">(index-filter #(&gt; % 10) (take 20 fib-seq))

</code></pre><h3 id="generality">Generality</h3><p>So what was a 40 line program that only worked on strings is now
a 4-5 line program that works on anything. This type of shortening
<em>nearly</em> as well in another dynamic language like Python, Ruby, Javascript.</p><p>But i would argue Clojures has less language constructs then many of the other
dynamic languages i have used and so tends to have better re-use of abstractions
and functions which leads to smaller and more perform ant solutions overall.  This is because
clojure is made up of PICOs</p><h3 id="plain-immutable-collection-objects-picos">Plain Immutable collection objects PICOS.</h3><p>While in many other languages you have a multiplication of types
each with their own functions. In clojure, in stead of the developer defining
new classes you just have:</p><ul><li><b>P</b>lain: lists, maps, sets.</li><li><b>I</b>immutable: less defensive code.</li><li><b>C</b>ollections: tons of existing (highly performant) functions already work on them.</li><li><i>Objects</i></li></ul><h3 id="and-we-model-everything-in-clojure-this-way">And we model everything in clojure this way:</h3><ul><li>collections</li><li>directories</li><li>files</li><li>XML</li><li>JSON</li><li>result sets</li><li>web requests</li><li>web responses</li><li>sessions</li></ul><p>Which means you can do things like model the HTML</p><pre><code class="klipse-reagent nohighlight">(require '[reagent.core :as r])

</code></pre><p>What should be of interest to you at this point is that we haven't worried about the inputs and outputs.

</code></pre><h3 id="generality-in-persistence">Generality in persistence:</h3><p>In order to build real services we need more then just a programming language, we
need a persistent store. Of course Clojure can use any database (just like any language) but it
has a lot of harmony with a particular database called Datomic. There is a <em>lot</em> we could say about it, but
what i want to focus on is how you interact with it when programming.</p><p>Here is a datalog query (which is the query language of datomic):</p><pre><code>[:find ?title
 :where
 [_ :movie/title ?title]]
</code></pre><pre><code># results...
"First Blood"
"Terminator 2: Judgment Day"
"The Terminator"
"Rambo III"
"Predator 2"
"Lethal Weapon"
"Lethal Weapon 2"
"Lethal Weapon 3"
"Alien"

</code></pre><p>Dont' worry about how the query langauge works. Whats awesome is that this query is built using the same primitives as the rest of the language. Particularly its written in extensible data notation (edn)
which is similar to Json, but it:</p><ul><li>Is extensible with user defined value types</li><li>Has more base types</li><li>Is a subset of clojure data</li></ul><h3 id="benefits-of-clojure-2">Benefits of clojure</h3><ul><li>concision</li><li>generality</li><li><b>robustness</b></li><li>agility</li></ul><img src="/img/clojure-simple-by-design-53-638.jpg" /><p>The result is that our programs are more robust and easier to understand
and potentially faster because we let the language handle lower level
details.</p><h3 id="safety-where-you-need-it">Safety where you need it.</h3><p>Lets say your work for a very important business whose API accepts
Big Even Numbers from important discerning clients.</p><p>First some grunt work to pull in the required libraries:</p><pre><code class="klipse-cljs nohighlight">(ns my.spec
  (:require [clojure.spec.alpha :as s]
            [clojure.spec.gen.alpha :as gen]))

</code></pre><p>Now we define our big even specification:</p><pre><code class="klipse-cljs nohighlight">(s/def ::big-even (s/and integer? even? #(&gt; % 1000)))
</code></pre><p>We confirm it works..</p><pre><code class="klipse-cljs nohighlight">(s/valid? ::big-even 10)
</code></pre><pre><code class="klipse-cljs nohighlight">(s/valid? ::big-even 100000)
</code></pre><p>Now we can attach this to our API and catch any nasty none big numbers
that try to get in...</p><pre><code class="klipse-cljs nohighlight">(s/explain-data ::big-even 5)
</code></pre><p>And just as important, we can use that specification to generator as many big
even numbers as we want and use them as inputs.</p><pre><code>(gen/sample ::big-even )
