    <p>This is a WIP</p><h2 id="intro">INTRO</h2><p>What I'm going to say will sound like madness. You will not believe it, but I promise you haven't seen this theory yet.</p><p>If you want prose and storytelling, I have written an entire <a href="https://drewverlee.github.io/pages-output/shadows-on-the-wal">series</a> covering the same ideas.  We're going to explore the idea that Auri might be shaping Kvothe. In order to start this journey, were going to first examining some interesting on connections between the Fae and the Underthing. Let's jump in.</p><h2 id="as-below-so-above">As Below So Above</h2><p>Recall Kvothe and Felurian traveling through the fae on the way to make a shaed?</p><blockquote><p>So I followed, naked and unprepared. Felurian struck out at a good pace, the <strong>moss</strong> muffling the
sound of our bare feet. ~ Kvothe:TWMF:660</p></blockquote><p>Moss is also the same way Auri describes the carpet in Annulet, which is in Wains, which is part of the Underthing.</p><blockquote><p>plush of the carpet was sweet beneath her feet, like <strong>moss</strong>... ~ Auri:SROST:28</p></blockquote><p>I can physically feel your eyes rolling in doubt. Just stay with me. Let's let Auri describe Annulet:</p><blockquote><p>Auri brushed off her hands, swung the door
open, and stepped lightly into Wains. The hallway was wide enough to drive a
wagon through. High-ceilinged and long enough that Foxen’s light could barely
reach the tangle of debris that blocked the far end. Above her, <strong>bluewhite</strong> light
scattered off a <strong>crystal chandelier</strong>. <strong>Dark wood</strong> paneling hugged the lower portion
of the walls, but above that was ornate plasterwork. There were broad <strong>frescoes</strong>
decorating the ceiling. <strong>Women in gauze lounged about</strong> whispering and rubbing oil on each other. Men
frolicked about in the water, flapping around ridiculously in their absolute
altogether.  ~ AURI:SROST:1:35</p></blockquote><p>Let's make a list of the things she sees:</p><ul><li>bluewhite light</li><li>dark wood</li><li>Crystal chandelier</li><li>frescoes</li><li>painting of naked men and woman frolicking and running oil on each other</li></ul><p>We know from Kvothe's time in the fae that he went naked quite a bit:</p><blockquote><p>I almost went back to grab my clothes, then decided to follow some advice my father had given me
when I was young. “Everyone eats a different part of the pig,” he’d said. “You want to fit in, you’ll do
the same.” Different places, different decorums. ~ TWMF:660</p></blockquote><p>And so this painting/frescoe of naked frolicking could be of the fae. Lets return to Kvothe and Felurians trip to gather more information:</p><blockquote><p>I was reminded of a vast, empty <strong>cathedral</strong> swathed in sooty velvet. ~ Kvothe:TWMF:1343</p></blockquote><p>Frescoes are also commonly seen in  <strong>cathedrals</strong>, the word kvothe uses to describe this area of the fae. Furthermore, the pictures included in the SROST of this room feature arches &amp; pillars just like you would find in a cathedral. Pillars being another descriptor that kvothe uses for the fae:</p><blockquote><p>Light swelled and I caught a moment’s glimpse of our surroundings. <strong>Dark trunks</strong> of trees rose like
massive <strong>pillars</strong> as far as the eye could see.  ~ Kvothe:TWMF:661</p></blockquote><p>The fae has <strong>dark wood</strong> tree's that Kvothe thinks of as pillars and Auri's room has pillars and *<em>dark wood</em> paneling. What's more, one meaning to the word Annulet is a band encircling a column (or pillar). Back to our list, the bluewhite light and cyrstal chandeliers best fit to the stars Kvothe see's.</p><blockquote><p>Above us, the twilight sky was slowly growing darker. Eventually, the last hint of purple was gone, leaving the sky a perfect <strong>velvet black</strong>, flecked with <strong>unfamiliar stars</strong>. ~ KVOTHE:TWMF:660</p></blockquote><p>Though the stars aren't specifically mentioned as bluewhite, likely because blue is a common tint around stars. But as Kvothe keeps walking it becomes pitch black. At this point you should take off your tin foil hat and eat it, you will need the power it provides. Guess where it's also mostly dark? Under the couch in the in Annulet.</p><blockquote><p>A <strong>plush couch</strong> on a plush carpet. ~ SROST:1:27</p></blockquote><p>Pop quiz, whats the difference between plush and velvet? They are both types of fabric the difference is that plush has a longer pile (raised surface).  So he is saying the sky is akin to a fabric, and now i'm (against all reason) telling you that's not a metaphor. Kvothe is double down on his the sky is like a fabric connection by using the word swathed:</p><blockquote><blockquote><p>I was reminded of a vast, empty cathedral <strong>swathed</strong> in sooty velvet. ~ Kvothe:TWMF:661</p></blockquote></blockquote><p>As swathed means to be wrapped in several languages of fabric. Your surprised? Why? You were told the nature of the fae.</p><blockquote><p>She laughed at my tone. “no. the faen realm.” she waved widely. “wrought according to their will.
the greatest of them sewed it from <strong>whole cloth</strong>. a place where they could do as they desired. ~ Felurian:TWMF:673</p></blockquote><p>You thought it was a metaphor, but glammourie and grammarie makes such things possible::</p><blockquote><p>“It’s for everything. Faerie gold feels heavy. And a glamoured pig would smell like roses when you kissed it. ~ Bast:TLT</p></blockquote><p>Their more real but also lies, more and less, the idiom <em>out of whole cloth</em> means <em>fabrication/lies</em>.</p><p>You wanted deep magic, here it is. The only thing in doubt is the scale. Let's leave that for a moment, we have <em>much</em> more to discuss. Auri says the couch is fainting:</p><blockquote><p>Auri lounged upon the fainting couch. ~SROST:130</p></blockquote><p>fainting because she catches her breath on it?</p><blockquote><p>Auri laughed, delighted. “That’s a piece.” She grinned. “Try for more.” ~Auri:NOTW:675</p></blockquote><p>(deep sigh) <em>Faenting</em>? Ok, your not buying it? How about this then, Kvothe describes the darkness like a warm blanket.</p><blockquote><p>By now the darkness was so thick I could almost feel it like a warm blanket around me. ~ TWMF:663</p></blockquote><p>These metaphors seem to align a lot with things that happen in Annulet (The perfect sitting room). Auri actually draps a blanket over places in Annulet:</p><blockquote><p>Auri carried the blanket all the way down to Wains and
into her new perfect sitting room.
She draped it over the <strong>back of the couch.</strong> She
folded it and set it in the chair. Finally, in true desperation, Auri set her
jaw and spread her blanket flat across the lush red rug in the center of the
room. ~ Auri:SROST:90</p></blockquote><p>Backing up in the story, it's now important to recall something in Annulet was bothering her:</p><blockquote><p>The tiny wrongness was still there, like a hint of gristle in her teeth.  ~ Auri:SROST:39</p></blockquote><p>In her search she notices a tiny whiteness under the couch:</p><blockquote><p>The dark
plush of the carpet was sweet beneath her feet, like moss, and when she bent
down to run her fingers over the hush of it, she glimpsed a <strong>tiny whiteness</strong>
underneath the couch. She reached deep into the shadows with a small white hand,
having to stretch a bit before her fingers caught it. Smooth and cool. It was a
tiny figurine carved from a piece of pale, retiring stone. A small soldier with
clever lines to show his hauberk and his shield. But his truest treasure was the
sweetness of his face, kind enough for kissing. ~ Auri:SROST:28</p></blockquote><p>Now from Kvothe's perspective...</p><blockquote><p>Thinking myself clever, I made a sympathetic binding for <strong>light</strong> and held my hand
above my head as if it were a torch. I was more than slightly proud of this, as the motion-to-light
binding is rather difficult without a piece of metal to use as a focus.
Light swelled and I caught a moment’s glimpse of our surroundings. <strong>Dark trunks</strong> of trees rose like
massive <strong>pillars</strong> as far as the eye could see. There were no low-hanging branches, no undergrowth, no
grass. Only dark <strong>moss</strong> underfoot and the <strong>arch</strong> of dark branches overhead. I was reminded of a vast,
empty <strong>cathedral</strong> swathed in sooty <strong>velvet</strong>.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>There was a soft sound of movement above us, as if someone was folding a huge piece of <strong>velvet</strong>
around a piece of <strong>broken glass</strong>. Saying that I realize it makes no sense, but still, that is the best way I
can describe the sound. It was a soft noise, the half-heard sound of deliberate movement. I cannot tell
you why it made me think of something terrible and sharp, but it did. My forehead prickled with
sweat, and I was filled with a sudden pure and breathless terror. ~ Kvothe:TWMF</p></blockquote><p>A light, a hand reaches, kvothe senses velvet wrapped over broken glass.</p><blockquote><p>She was full of <strong>broken glass</strong> and burrs. She was weary and disappointed with all of everything. ~ Auri:SROST:89</p></blockquote><p>And what does Auri bring back from under the couch? A "tiny figuring" Which later she recognizes as a solider:</p><blockquote><p>A small soldier with
clever lines to show his hauberk and his shield. But his truest treasure was the
sweetness of his face, kind enough for kissing. ~ Auri:SROST:28</p></blockquote><p>And finally she calls a ciridae. Though I suspect she is shaping it to be just that.</p><blockquote><p>She did not know how she had missed these things before. It was a tiny <strong>Ciridae</strong>.  ~ Auri:SROST:146</p></blockquote><p>I mean, what a bunch of crazy consequences...</p><blockquote><p>There was another flicker of lightning, and I saw her standing closer. She pointed at me, grinning
delightedly. “You look like an Amyr,” she said. “Kvothe is one of the <strong>Ciridae</strong>.” ~ Auri:TWMF:194</p></blockquote><p>Lets tally this up</p><ol><li>moss</li><li>naked frolicking</li><li>dark wood</li><li>cathedral</li><li>velvet</li><li>pillars</li><li>swayed ~ plush</li><li>faent ~ faint</li><li>blanket</li><li>chair</li><li>broken glass</li><li>ciridae</li></ol><p>Look, is it madness? Yes. But it's lot of madness in a story we all know and love to be stepped in mystery. You think Auri might be Ariel? I think so to, but she won't be the first by the name. Ariel, is a powerful fairy in Shakespeare's play (The Tempest), whose gender changes from telling to telling. Here hidden under all of everything is a broken girl who has a book of secrets (see srost pictures), just like Jax won from the tinker...</p><blockquote><p>A book of secrets. A piece of iron that fell from the sky.... ~TWMF:572</p></blockquote><p>And similar they both have a clay mug.</p><blockquote><p>Jax brought out some water in a cracked clay mug. ~TWMF:571</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>She set the cracked clay cup atop a squat glass jar. ~ SROST:110</p></blockquote><p>The world bends to her will, and what what is it she wills? A candle for Kvothe.</p><blockquote><p>She knew the patient way of things. Grind and boil the waxy fruit. Sieve off the
dottle. Boil again and clarify and cool to separate the wax. Even with the
proper tools it would be hours of work. Hours and hours. But he was coming soon.
She knew. She knew she had no time for it. And even if she had all day. There
would be principles inside the wax that were not right for him. He was plum full
of anger and despair. And pride... well, he had that in a sure and certain
surfeit. There were ways to factor those things out. She knew them all. She knew
the turning circles of the calcinate. She could sublime and draw. She could
isolate a non-exclusionary principle as well as any who had ever turned their
hand to work the craft.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>But this was not a time for begging favors from the moon. Not now. She could not
rush and neither could she be delayed. Some things were simply too important. It
was just as Mandrag said: Nine tenths of alchemy was chemistry. And nine tenths
of chemistry was waiting.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>The other piece? That slender tenth part of a tenth? The heart of alchemy was
something Auri had learned long ago. She’d studied it before she came to
understand the true shape of the world. Before she knew the key to being small.
Oh yes. She’d learned her craft. She knew its hidden roads and secrets. All the
subtle, sweet, and coaxing ways that made one skilled within the art. So many
different ways. Some folk inscribed, described. There were symbols. Signifiers.
Byne and binding. Formulae. Machineries of maths... But now she knew much more
than that. So much of what she’d thought was truth before was merely tricks. No
more than clever ways of speaking to the world. They were a bargaining. A plea.
A call. A cry. But underneath, there was a secret deep within the hidden heart
of things. Mandrag never told her that. She did not think he knew. Auri found
that secret for herself. She knew the true shape of the world. All else was
shadow and the sound of distant drums. Auri nodded to herself. Her tiny face was
grave. She scooped the waxy fineground fruit into a sieve and set the sieve atop
a gather jar. She closed her eyes. She drew her shoulders back. She took a slow
and steady breath. There was a tension in the air. A weight. A wait. There was
no wind. She did not speak. The world grew stretched and tight. Auri drew a
breath and opened up her eyes. Auri was urchin small. Her tiny feet upon the
stone were bare. Auri stood, and in the circle of her golden hair she grinned
and brought the weight of her desire down full upon the world.</p><p>And all things shook. And all things knew her will. And all things bent to
please her.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>It was not long before Auri returned to Mantle with a sorrel colored candle
pressed with lavender.</p></blockquote><p>~SROST:145</p><p>So much of magic is tricks. Much more then Kvothe believes. The symbols and runes...</p><blockquote><p>“Those are the runes.” I pointed. “Clear as day. And those are metallurgical symbols.” I looked ~  TWMF:226</p></blockquote><p>even the bindings of sympathy, like the pine:</p><blockquote><p>It took me about two hours to figure out that the pine pitch wasn’t necessary. When I asked him, Ben admitted that it was merely an aid for concentration. I think he was surprised that I figured it out without being told. ~ NOTW:79</p></blockquote><p>are simply tricks, methods necessary for the mind to believe what it can simply do:</p><blockquote><p>“But how?” I asked for the tenth time. “Light hasn’t any weight, any substance. It behaves like a
wave. You shouldn’t be able to touch it.”
Felurian had worked her way up from starlight and was wefting moonlight into the shaed. She
didn’t look up from her work when she replied, “so many thoughts, my kvothe. you know too much
to be happy.”
That sounded uncomfortably like something Elodin would say. I brushed the evasion aside. “You
shouldn’t be able—”
She nudged me with her elbow and I saw both her hands were full. “sweet flame,” she said, “bring
that to me.” She nodded to a moonbeam that pierced the trees above and touched the ground beside
me.
Her voice bore the familiar, subtle tone of command, and without thinking I grabbed the
moonbeam as if it were a hanging vine. For a second I felt it against my fingers, cool and ephemeral.
Startled, I froze, and suddenly it was an ordinary moonbeam again. I passed my hand through it
several times to no effect.
Smiling, Felurian reached out and took hold of it as if it were the most natural thing in the world.
She touched my cheek with her free hand, then turned her attention to her lap and worked the strand of
moonlight into the folds of shadow. ~TWMF:677</p></blockquote><p>Auri understands that hundredth piece, the hidden heart of things. Her candle making is alchemy. And what is Alchemy? Read more <a href="https://drewverlee.github.io/pages-output/alchemy">here</a>. But here is the heart of it from Pat himself:</p><blockquote><p>Alchemy is a process of extracting like platonic forms from objects. So you can pull the drunkenness from wine, and have it, and put it in something else. Or you could just take the wine and pull the hangover out of it. ~ Patrick rothfuss</p></blockquote><p>Auri says Alchemy is art</p><blockquote><p>Whoever wrought and factored this was living proof that alchemy was art. ~ SROST:52</p></blockquote><p>Felurian and Bast tell you that art is the fae word for magic possible for shaping:</p><blockquote><p>“Okay. Here’s
the bones of what I know. They don’t think of it as magic. They’d never use that
term. They’ll talk of art or craft. They talk of seeming or shaping.” ~TLT</p></blockquote><p>Seeming and Shaping. Auri is a powerful Shaper. It isn't a candle that is being shaped, but Kvothe. To understand shaping you must understand the feelings that are added and extracted. She is factoring out his pride and anger...</p><blockquote><p>would be principles inside the wax that were not right for him. He was plum full
of anger and despair. And pride... well, he had that in a sure and certain
surfeit. There were ways to factor those things out.</p></blockquote><p>And while pride and anger can be your downfall, it's also what pushes you to rise, the passion:</p><blockquote><p>Besides, anger can keep you warm at night, and wounded pride can spur a man to wondrous things.</p></blockquote><p>And Kvothe has anger to spare.</p><blockquote><p>Auri eyed the laurel fruit
It was every bit as <strong>reverent</strong>
as one might expect, but it was <strong>prideful too</strong>. And held a hint of north wind’s
chill. That needed to be tempered. And ... yes. There was a thread of <strong>anger</strong>
running through it too. She sighed. That would not do at all. ~SROST:140</p></blockquote><p>And what is in the honey wax?</p><blockquote><p>Auri eyed the melting wax and nodded. It was a <strong>drowsy</strong> thing. All <strong>autumn sweetness</strong>,
<strong>diligence</strong>, and <strong>due reward</strong>. The <strong>bells</strong> were not unwelcome either. There was
nothing in it that she did not want for him. ~SROST:141</p></blockquote><p>Drowsiness, autumn, diligence and due reward. And what is bells?</p><blockquote><p>Oh. But the
honeycomb. It was lovely. Not one bit stolen. The farmer loved the bees and did
things in the proper way. It was full of <strong>silent bells</strong> and drowsy summer
afternoon. ~SROST:73</p></blockquote><p>silence...</p><p>Kote is diligent</p><blockquote><p>A few minutes later Kote returned with a bucket of soapy water. Without
looking in the storyteller’s direction, he began to gently, methodically, wash
his bottles. One at a time, Kote wiped their bottoms clean of the strawberry
wine and set them on the bar... ~NOTW:48</p></blockquote><p>Kote's due reward is the Waystone.</p><blockquote><p>I felt a nervous chill when Hillside was mentioned. I ignored it as best I could and nodded. “You have a lovely inn here. I’d count myself lucky to have one as nice when I’ve grown up.” I handed him the penny. ~NOTW:241</p></blockquote><p>Kote's silence is as deep and wide as autumn's ending:</p><blockquote><p>The Waystone was his, just as the third <strong>silence</strong> was his. This was appropriate, as it was the greatest
silence of the three, holding the others inside itself. It was deep and wide as <strong>autumn’s</strong> ending. It was
heavy as a great riversmooth stone. It was the patient, cut-flower sound of a man who is waiting to
die. ~NOTW:605</p></blockquote><p>Auri loves kvothe, she obsesses over him, she doesn't need his protection, she is well and truly capable of doing as she pleases. And it pleases her to forge a new name for him, and one day have him by her side cloaked in mantle:</p><blockquote><p>She smiled. Auri returned to Mantle. She washed her face
and hands and feet. Excitement bubbling up inside of her, Auri looked at his
bed. His blanket. His bedshelf with the tiny Amyr waiting there to guard him. It
was perfect. It was right. It was a start. He would need a place someday, and it
was here all ready for him. Someday he would come, and she would tend to him.
<strong>Someday he would be the one all eggshell hollow empty in the dark.</strong> And then...
Auri smiled. Not for herself. No. Not ever for herself. She must stay small and
tucked away, wellhidden from the world. But for him it was a different thing
entire. For him she would bring forth all her desire. She would call up all her
cunning and her craft. Then <strong>she would make a name for him</strong>. Auri spun about three
times. She smelled the air. She grinned. All around her everything was proper
true. She knew exactly where she was. She was exactly where she ought to be.</p></blockquote>
