In long...</p><p>The Kingkiller Chronicle's journey is powerful; it moves the heart. It's best if you experience it yourself, rather than me rob you of the joy. Journey before destination, and all that. In that vein, allow me to tell a brief story of a <a href="/pages-output/the-boy-who-ran">boy who ran</a> too fast. It is only an echo of the stories told in Temerant, but hopefully, it will dull the ache of waiting for more stories from Rothfuss while appropriately setting the tone of the greater story I hope to unfold here. I have also put together a short poem about how to read the King Killer Chronicle and part of a stone that sits in my heart. I cast it into the water, I hope the river will take it where it needs to go. I call it the <a href="/pages-output/the-hope-a-spring-sun-brings">The hope a spring sun brings</a>.</p><p>So, I suggest you read around a <em>lot</em> before tackling this. That means all the books a couple of times. See the last section, "Citations," for a list. It also means spending some time on the forums. I'm not suggesting I have the right of things. Or all of it. Instead, I'm saying it's a lot more fun to arrive at your own conclusions before hearing others. So capital S Spoilers and possible BS ahead, you decided which.</p><p>Enough of warnings, we look forward now, shadows on the horizon, drums in the deep.</p><h1 id="warrens-widdershins-ways-and-woes">Warrens Widdershins Ways and Woes</h1><img src="/img/spoem.png" height="500px" width="400px" /><p><em>Come sister Sparrow come brother Wolf</em></p><p><em>Warrens widdershins ways and woes</em><br /><em>Summer squalls, winters rose</em><br /><em>Now a tale every midwife knows</em></p><p><em>Listen close Ash and Elm</em></p><p><em>Nekkid toes, crooked noes</em><br /><em>Hollow fallow, butter brine</em><br /><em>How mother Rabbit stole time</em></p><hr /><h2 id="intro">Intro</h2><p>The main theory is that Auri is Shaping Kvothes life from those of Lanre and Selitos. To go further, I must be sure you understand as much about the Fae, their magic, Waystones, and Alchemy as possible. I'll give an overview of the requirements in the next section called "A careful look". Then will pick up the main theory thread in the section titled "A Humerus Chandelier".</p><h2 id="a-careful-look">A careful look</h2><p>To understand the conclusion, that Auri is Shaping Kvothe. You need to understand the craft she uses to do it. Discussing the means, broadly speaking <em>Fae magic</em> and Alchemy. Are topics in their own right, and so it's better to break them out. If your not sure how Fae do what they do, then here is a piece on <a href="/pages-output/bitter-brew">Fae magic</a>, where we learn from Bast and observe him working his craft in the book "The Lighting Tree". Similarly, you will need to understand <a href="/pages-output/alchemy">Alchemy</a> to follow Auri's candle making. Most importantly, if you find your-self in doubt that Auri is visiting <em>Newarre and the Mauthen farm</em> the read  <a href="/pages-output/how-to-get-to-newarre">How to get to Newarre</a> where I isolate the topic. I won't be covering that here, as it's too distracting. If you doubt that Auri could get there quickly, then read <a href="/pages-output/ways-to-safe-places">Ways to safe places</a>. Each post will try to have a summary or conclusion at the top. If you agree with it, confidently move on.</p><h2 id="a-humerus-chandelier">A Humerus Chandelier</h2><img src="/img/auri_honeycomb_c.jpg" height="500px" width="350px" /><p>Our theory is that Auri is shaping Kvothe From Lanre and Selitos, who are represented  by two items she finds in the Underthing. To clarify, ill be keeping track of the items (what) and who in a table. The starting point, which will explain shortly, is here:</p><table style="width:50%"><tr><th>Who</th><th>What</th></tr><tr><td>Lanre</td><td>Arm Bone</td></tr><tr><td>Selitos</td><td>Crystal</td></tr></table> 
<p>...</p><p>We first need to establish how these items are like these historical figures. This is done multiple ways, mostly by association.</p><p>E.g If I said, my new boss sure is a bear. And later I said, he is really grizzly today. We would count this as two connections from my boss to a bear.</p><p>The starting point for this theory happens in the repeated use of a single body part where typically it's counter would be involved forms a pattern. There are two instances of this very close together in the narrative. The more unusual of the two repeats itself when Lanre is described  as having "strength of <strong>arm</strong>" rather then "strength of arms" NOWT:26:184:</p><blockquote><p>..Lanre had the strength of his arm and the command of loyal men...</p></blockquote><p>NOWT:26:187:</p><blockquote><p>..his (Lanre) power lay in the strength of his arm.</p></blockquote><p>The second instance is also unusual, but also directly part of the plotline. And so receives an understandable amount of attention.</p><p>NOWT:26:190:</p><blockquote><p>Selitos drew a deep breath. “By my eye I was deceived, never again....” He
raised the stone and drove its needle point into his own eye.</p></blockquote><p>NOTW:28:197:</p><blockquote><p>Selitos One-Eye stood forward and said, “Lord, if I do thi....</p></blockquote><p>From here we are going to follow these items separately for a bit tell they come back together, in different forms at the end.</p><h2 id="breaking-bones">Breaking Bones</h2><img src="/img/bone.jpg" height="250px" width="250px" vspace="20px" hspace="20px" /><p>In Slow Regard of Silent Things (SROST), Auri finds a bone. SROST:1:24:</p><blockquote><p>she had found: a clean white bone.
Long, but not a leg. An arm. The prima axial. She ran her fingers down the
length of it and felt a tiny seam that ran all round it like a ring, showing it
had broken and long-healed. It was full of pleasant shadows.</p></blockquote><p>Here comes the analogies and metaphors we talked about before, were not going to discuss why this is important now, rather just note the alike this bone the "Prima Axial is" to Lanre:</p><ol><li>The word axial is similar to Alaxel, who the Adem's song tells us is the lord of the Seven.</li><li>prima  means "leading man" which Lanre certainly is.</li><li>"axial" isn't the name for any arm bone, but rather a collection of the middle parts of the body,
as shown <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Axial_skeleton">here</a>. Auri, who studied
at the university, would know this.</li><li>The arm being broken and healed is to Lanre being killed and raised</li><li>The arm being full of shadows is like Lanre being surrounded by shadows.</li><li>In Vintish culture, a bone ring (see "tiny seam" from quote), indicates a profound and lasting debt, which Lanre has for his life returned.</li><li>That it's an arm bone, and he was known for his strength of arm.</li></ol><p>Roughly seven associations. After retrieving the bone, Auri puts it near some holly, that she has on her.  SROST:1:24:</p><blockquote><p>The bone nestled almost indecently close to the holly berry.</p></blockquote><p>Holly is a topic all on it's own that I ramble about <a href="pages-outputs/holly">here</a>. You might want to refer back to it later, for now lets move on. What Auri does next is put, I would argue <em>trades</em>, the bone for Laurel Fruit, by placing the Bone inside the Laurel Tree. SROST:4:70:</p><img src="/img/gravetree.jpg" height="300px" width="300px" /><blockquote><p>Auri reached into her gathersack and brought out the bone that she
had found the day before. She bent down and tucked it deep inside the dark and
hollow space beneath the tree.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>Then she began to pick the small blue laurel fruit and put them in her gathersack as well.</p></blockquote><p>I dive into if this could be the Latantha or the Cthaeh's tree <a href="/pages-output/gravetree">here</a>. In the end I chose the Mauthen Farm, because there is more evidence. A gentle reminder that I cover the locations in detail in my post <a href="/pages-output/how-get-get-to-newarre">How to get to Newarre</a>.</p><img src="/img/farmer.jpg" height="500px" width="350px" /><p>More importantly, what is our little Auri doing at barrow-hill? Is she just being cute whimsical harmless Auri? Dancing around seeing the proper ways of things? Is this connected to some magic we have seen or have yet to see? I don't recall an emphasis being put on any particular tree on the Farm, could the Laurel tree represent something else to Auri? The barrow itself? Could it stand for Kvothe's mother Laurel? What does it mean for the story? Will cover this at the end, in the section "The Book of Secrets".</p><p>This is the end of the arm bone's journey, though it continues through the Laurel Fruit which will pick up later. Next we will focus on the other item she finds, a Crystal and the similarities its shares with Selitos.</p><h1 id="crystals-and-blood">Crystal's and Blood</h1><hr /><img src="/img/crystal.jpg" height="250px" width="250px" /><p>Auri finds a Crystal in the Underthing. SROST:1:27:</p><blockquote><p>After a dozen steps, a glimmer on the marble floor caught her eye. Skipping
close, she saw a crystal had fallen from the chandelier to lay unbroken on the
floor. It was a lucky thing, and brave.</p></blockquote><p>The Crystal is like the mountain glass Seltios used to stab his eye. The relationship here is thin here, only that Crystal is similar to glass. But it's immediately strengthened as the Crystal is put near a Ciridae doll. Given Selitos was the founder of the Amyr, of whom the Ciridae were the highest rank, this gives us two connections to the lord of Myr Tariniel.</p><img src="/img/Pairs_Commonwealth_Amyr.webp" height="400px" width="320px" /><p>Let's take a look at the relevant parts in SROST about the doll, just to show that indeed, she calls it a Ciridae and groups it with the Crystal. SROST:1:28</p><blockquote><p>It was a tiny figurine carved from a piece of pale, retiring stone. A small
soldier with clever lines to show his hauberk and his shield. But his truest
treasure was the sweetness of his face, kind enough for kissing. It didn’t
belong here, but it wasn’t wrong. Or rather, it wasn’t what was wrong with the
room. The poor thing was simply lost. Auri smiled and put the doll in her
pocket with the crystal</p></blockquote><p>Later we learn more about the doll. SROST:10:146:</p><blockquote><p>the design upon its shield. It was so faint. But yes. There was the tower
wrapped up in a tongue of flame. No mere soldier, it was a small stone Amyr.
Peering closer, Auri spied slight lines upon his arms as well. She did not
know how she had missed these things before. It was a tiny Ciridae.</p></blockquote><p>After that, Auri adds white tatted lace to the same pocket as the Ciridae and Crystal. SROST:1:32</p><blockquote><p>she found a length of fine white tatted lace. She folded this up carefully and
put it in her pocket with the crystal and the small stone soldier</p></blockquote><p>The white tatted lace is likely symbolizes Nettie Williams, Rike's mom.</p><img src="/img/bastandgirl.jpg" height="350px" width="210px" align="right" /><p>Finally, Auri trades the Crystal for the William's butter &amp; honeycomb. She leaves the Crystal under the Lighting Tree near the Williams house. For reasons only Auri can truly understand. Though later, will do our best to put it all together.</p><p>This Tree isn't the Cthaeh, so near a farm with milk, honey and curious eyes. This could possible be the Sword Tree, but while the butter has knives, there are no mountains, mercenaries, or swords to see. So then, The Lighting Tree.</p><img src="/img/lightingtree.jpeg" height="500px" width="300px" /><hr /><p>I gave an overview, but let me highlight the relevant sections in SROST where Auri makes this trade. This happens in three parts:</p><ol><li>Auri trades for the Nettie's butter &amp; honeycomb for her White Tatted Lace.</li><li>She is spotted by Tess, this increases the cost of the trade.</li><li>She leaves the crystal in the tree to pay the extra debt</li></ol><hr /><p>SROST:4:74</p><ol><li>The trade:</li></ol><blockquote><p>Carefully she brought out the length of fine white tatted lace. She folded it
and left it near the churn. It was the careful work of many long and drowsy
autumn days. It would find <strong>purpose</strong> in a place like this. Then Auri took the
clean white cloth that had held the hollyberry earlier and rubbed it with some
butter.</p></blockquote><p>She only takes a bit of butter and the honeycomb.</p><img src="/img/honey.jpg" height="200px" width="200px" /><ol start="2"><li>She is spotted by Tess.</li></ol><blockquote><p>a prickle on her neck told her that she was being watched... A little girl was watching her</p></blockquote><ol start="3"><li>The debt between them is now higher, Auri has to give a bit more:</li></ol><blockquote><p>She cast her eyes around and saw a tree, a dark hole in its trunk ...</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>The hole was perfect, just deep enough so that a little girl
could reach inside and feel around. If she were curious, that is. If she were
brave enough to stick her arm in nearly to her shoulder.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>Auri pulled the crystal from her pocket. She kissed it, brave explorer that it
was, and lucky too. It was the perfect thing. This was the perfect place. True,
she was no longer in the Underthing. But even so, this was so true it could not
be denied. She wrapped the crystal in a leaf and lay it in the bottom of the
hole.</p></blockquote><p>Does Auri mean for the girl go after this Crystal and fall down the rabbit hole. Going on mad fun adventures with queens and Cheshire cats? Or is this a bobble, a bait, a way to float her down into the maw of darkness.</p><img src="/img/alice.jpeg" height="500px" width="300px" /><p>Finally, what <strong>purpose</strong> does our white tatted lace find? TLT:</p><blockquote><p>“I learned loads of things today, Reshi,” Bast protested. The
innkeeper sat up, looking more attentive. “Really?” he said. “Impress me then.”
Bast thought for a moment. “Nettie Williams found a wild hive of bees today,” he
said. “And she managed to catch the queen …”</p></blockquote><p>I'll leave you to ponder the implications for now. This is the end of the journey for the crystal, the begging of the honeycombs.</p><h2 id="interlude-tables">Interlude: tables</h2><table style="width:100%"><tr><th>Who</th><th>What</th><th>Near</th><th>Trade</th><th>Where</th></tr><tr><td>Lanre</td><td>Arm Bone</td><td>Holly Berry</td><td>Laurel Fruit</td><td>Barrow</td></tr><tr><td>Selitos</td><td>Crystal</td><td>Ciridae &amp; lace</td><td>Honey, butter &amp; lace</td><td>Lighting Tree</td></tr></table> 
<hr /><h1 id="wicked-wicking">Wicked Wicking</h1><p>Auri use's the honeycomb and laurel fruit to make a candle for kvothe. Without elaborating, the ingredients are:</p><ul><li>laurel fruit</li><li>honey</li><li>perfect lavender</li><li>melting wax</li><li>daub of perfect pitch</li><li>Auri's breath in whistle</li></ul><p>Sought, brought and paid for.

It was a thick candle that smelled of lavender. “What’s inside of it?” I asked. “Happy dreams,” she said. “I put them there for you.”</p></blockquote><p>As far as I can tell kvothe puts the candle in his box in Ankers. TWMF:50:358</p><blockquote><p>I finished loading my travelsack, then packed everything else into the trunk that sat at the foot of my bed.
