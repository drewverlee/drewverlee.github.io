    <p>The longer you watch the wind move, the more of the pattern unfolds, not truth, nothing like certainty, but a dance that runs deeper than both. And so will question stable foundations, Kvothe's given name, and see if we can discover more about our hero and ourselves. Kvothe's father taught him many things, stories, songs, and how to kiss. He told him his name means "to know".</p><blockquote><p>But I was brought up as Kvothe. My father once told me it meant “to know.” ~ NOTW:55</p></blockquote><p>But his tragic death robbed Kvothe of an important lesson or drove it home too far to be felt. Our fathers aren't perfect. They make mistakes, they sing songs they shouldn't. As we grow older with them, they become friends, and they can speak openly about their mistakes, and we gain the confidence to be uncertain. He said, Kvothe meant "to know", but I see more in the name, and I wonder if Arliden only had or gave half the story. So we start our journey for the full meaning of Kvothe's name with another famous name that ended in the same way Aethe. Gentle Tempi gives us the first piece we need to solve this puzzle:</p><blockquote><p>“Aesh. No arrow.” ~ TMWF:625</p></blockquote><p>It seems reasonable to assume Aesh means "no arrow". But how do we break it apart into its two parts: arrow and negation? The answer is found not far off, Aethe founded the school and sought mastery over the bow and <strong>arrow</strong>. The common root means <em>Ae</em> translates to "arrow". A fact the Adem's story underlines as Rethe lied dying with an arrow near her heart, wrote her first lines of wisdom:</p><blockquote><p>Aethe, near my heart. ~ TWMF:625</p></blockquote><p>Aethe was known for his skill in the arrow. Rethe his counter harmony, the feather that guided his arrow:</p><blockquote><p>She took a white feather from the arrow’s <strong>fletching</strong>, dipped it in her blood, and wrote four lines of poetry. ~ TWMF:757</p></blockquote><p>She was known for her understanding of the Lethani, the feather's wisdom, the gentle movement of the ribbon that became the foundation of Ademre. Both remembered for two ways of <em>knowing</em>, one a master, the other the first among servants. If you can see the way the wind moves there is no need to master it, you can move gently through the world. A balance Kvothe explored as he mastered the wind to reach the sword tree and moved with it to leave. The suffix <em>-the</em> comes up several more times, but none of them are a signpost: gilthe (guilder), the passionate warrior Penthe, the Centhe sea, and one other word will leave to the end. Let's turn our attention to the first half of his name _Kvo_the which he says is pronounced nearly the same as Quothe.</p><blockquote><p>My name is Kvothe, pronounced nearly the same as “Quothe.” Names are important as they tell you a great deal about a person. I’ve had more names than anyone has a right to. ~ NOTW:55</p></blockquote><p>We will play the same game as before and will find the pattern on the rooftops with master namer himself to guide us:</p><blockquote><p>He shrugged. “It was all a mistake though. Bad translation. They thought Quoyan was an early root of quetentan: question. But it isn’t. Quoyan means ‘wind.’ This is rightly named ‘the House of the Wind.’ ” ~ NOTW:502</p></blockquote><p>Quo, near in meaning to wind, but just out of reach. Our discovery feels so close to tangible, but when we grasp for it, we catch nothing but air. Have hope, for all is not lost, like Arliden showed us, puzzles with no answers aren't pointless. The path we took itself was meaningful, and there is one more stop on the road. The university ranks, we know of, are E'lir (seer), Re'lar (speaker), and El'the. The last ties the circle and brings us back to <em>-the</em>. Some say speaking is shaping, and that would leave us searching for their balance in Creation war and dance, the Knowers. I claim El'the is to know. But to know what? I have no hidden text, no riddle unraveled, only a magic so fundamental that it passes for nature. The proper way to move:</p><p>Know yourself for who you are,
See the world for what it is,
Speak your heart's desire,</p><p>Kvothe, Arliden's son and song of his heart desire, <em>to know the wind</em>.</p>
