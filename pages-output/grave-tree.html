    <h2 id="trees-and-truths">Trees and Truths</h2><img src="/img/gravetree.jpg" height="500px" width="350px" /><img src="/img/dayward.jpg" height="500px" width="350px" /><img src="/img/swordtree.webp" height="500px" width="350px" /><img src="/img/calltoadv.jpg" height="500px" width="350px" /><p><em>To fall dayward?</em></p><p><em>Or dance wayward?</em></p><p><em>Or do all roads lead to fire?</em></p><h2 id="which-tree-is-the-grave-yard-one">which tree is the grave yard one?</h2><ol><li>Auri described the Tree as lonely, which suits the Cthaeh very well. WMF:104:685:</li></ol><blockquote><p>And as I ran I could hear Cthaeh speaking behind me. Its dry, quiet voice
followed me longer than I would have thought possible. “Come back. Come back.
I’ve more to say. I’ve so much more to tell you, won’t you stay?”</p></blockquote><ol start="2"><li>The Cthaeh's dead butterfly's are like a graveyard.</li><li>At a long stretch, I think Kvothe will lay waste to Hearth trying to get to
Cinder who I believe he will find there, thus making it a graveyard.
So then the Adems stone houses as analogous to gravestones in two ways, which
only work based on a theory I haven't substantiated.</li><li>Only English/Cherry Laurel's have dark blue fruit in reality. That isn't the
tree featured in the book. It's possible someone: Pat or Auri is confused. It's
possible Auri was picking up the berries from the Ivy, which might make it
a Hedra <em>Helix</em>, which is a type of Ivy. The name of which is lose to Haliax. But word similarity is a
too thin to base an idea on alone</li><li>The Sword Tree fits Lanre better, who was known for his sword prowess.</li><li>Both Felurian and the Adem have <em>Ivy and Oak</em> in their <em>art</em>, The Laurel tree
with blue fruit isn't an oak, But there is a tree known as Laurel Oak that is
hard to tell apart from an oak.</li><li>Kovthe, when he won his talent pipes singing "The Lay of Sir Savien Traliard" compares Saviens voice to a "rock-old oak".</li></ol><p>NOTW:44:</p><blockquote><p>And we sang! Her voice like burning silver, my voice an echoing answer. Savien sang solid, powerful lines, like branches of a rock-old oak, all the while Aloine was like a nightingale, moving in darting circles around the proud limbs of it.</p></blockquote><p>Except, it's him singing. So we might say kvothe considers himself an Oak.</p><ol start="8"><li>Auri has ivory skin and Cinder has Ivory teeth, which might indicate an
addition of some sort. The obvious guess is Denner Resin, But i wonder if it isn't
Trillium, which kvothe calls Denna, which Felurian eats. aka <em>birthroot</em>:</li></ol><img src="/img/trill.jpeg" height="300px" width="300px" /><p>For me, If it has to be one of the two prime tree's, the Latantha is closer.
However, graveyard and lonely make it nearly a tie. In the end, i suspect <em>waves
hands</em> the tree's roots are linked. A theory I hope to cover <em>any day now</em>.</p><img src="/img/anydaynow.jpg" height="400px" width="250px" /><p>But let's have a taste shall we?</p><p>Celtic Mythology paints a picture of two who are one, but at war, warring with
against each other, warring with themselves. The Oak and Holly. During Midsummer
the Oak King is at the height of strength, the Holly king regains power at the
Autumn equinox, his power peaking at midwinter, at which point the oak king is
reborn.</p><img src="/img/hollyoak.jpeg" height="300px" width="400px" /><p>Guess who else dabbles in duality's?</p><img src="/img/summersoap.webp" height="225px" width="300px" /><img src="/img/perfectsoap.jpeg" height="225px" width="300px" /><p>Later, you might want to read  u/quoo's master piece theory on
Auri's <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/KingkillerChronicle/comments/48jv6c/kkc_spoilers_all_the_allegory_of_auris_magnum/">soap</a>,</p><p>I'm not suggesting that Celtic Mythology plays a role here, The Four
Corners has it's own lore. For one It's Ivy climbing Oak, Holly isn't an Ivy.</p><p>I'm just i'm highlighting that such devices are part of our blood, our very
creation, a topic I tried to capture in
<a href="https://www.dropbox.com/s/wkduktjjd5rc1gq/Story.pdf?dl=0"><em>story and art</em></a>. Here is a
sample of some of roaring heart wilting poetry i spin into being:</p><img src="/img/blackwhite.png" height="200px" width="400px" style="border: 5px solid #8B0000;" /><h2 id="exploration">Exploration</h2><p>This section is slightly more whimsical as it's the process of trying to connect the graveyard to another location.
Here are the descriptions of the graveyard tree that we need to match.</p><ul><li>ivy</li><li>graveyard / boneyard</li><li>monument w/ ivy</li><li>laurel tree</li><li>roots among the stone</li><li>warm scent</li><li>lonely</li></ul><p>In some <em>form</em> as they appear in the graveyard</p><h2 id="iron-fence">Iron fence</h2><p>No obvious Iron fence in either place. A full discussion about Iron
can't fit here, because i haven't made up my mind on it. Let's
say at best we might view.</p><h2 id="ivy">Ivy</h2><img src="/img/ivy.jpeg" height="250px" width="250px" /><p>Our grave stone has Ivy:</p><blockquote><p>A small, forgotten graveyard, stones overgrown with ivy.</p></blockquote><p><em>one for loving</em></p><blockquote><p>Felurian taught me ivy on the oak.</p></blockquote><p><em>one for hating</em></p><blockquote><p>she already had hold of my wrist, and soon had my arm tangled firmly in Ivy on the Oak.</p></blockquote><p><em>both for climbing</em></p><blockquote><p>There were climbing vines...</p></blockquote><p>These are both related to an oak however.</p><img src="/img/holm-oak.jpeg" height="250px" width="250px" /><h2 id="roses">Roses</h2><p>Here we might be looking simply for Red. In which case we have butterflies</p><blockquote><p>“The red ones offend my aesthetic,”</p></blockquote><p>And obviously Mercenaries</p><img src="/img/ademre.jpg" height="500px" width="300px" /><h2 id="graves">Graves</h2><p><em>one for hating</em></p><blockquote><p>The ground below was not a resting place for butterflies . . . it was strewn with lifeless wings.</p></blockquote><p><em>one for fighting</em></p><blockquote><p>Shehyn and i returned to the complex of stone buildings</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>she entered the low stone building</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>At first glance, Haert seemed to be this sort of town. It was little more than tiny homes, broken stone, and the occasional penned goat.</p></blockquote><p>ok, so why are the Haert's stone homes like gravestones? Well, they aren't when
kvothe visits the first time. I suspect they <em>will be</em> when he leaves the second time.</p><p>One word for now. <em>Cinder</em></p><h2 id="monument">Monument</h2><p>There is no monument mentioned explicity near either Tree. I only
have questions about the Adem's <em>wall</em></p><blockquote><p>pieced together like a jigsaw. Looking closer, I was puzzled by the lack of
mortar. I tapped it with a knuckle, wondering briefly if it might be a single
piece of stone carved to look like many stones fit together.</p></blockquote><h2 id="lonely-thing">Lonely Thing</h2><p>The Cthaeh is hateful, but that's likely in part <em>because</em> it is Lonely.</p><blockquote><p>And as I ran I could hear Cthaeh speaking behind me. Its dry, quiet voice followed me longer than I would have thought possible. “Come back. Come back. I’ve more to say. I’ve so much more to tell you, won’t you stay?”</p></blockquote><p>It's a vicious cycle. It knows everyone will leave it. The Latantha seem's to have lots of friends to dance with.</p><h2 id="laurel-tree--fruit">Laurel Tree &amp; Fruit</h2><p>lets look at the laurel "tree". It's actually hard to pin down anything without the specific Latin species name.
It seem's</p><img src="/img/gravetree.jpg" height="500px" width="400px" /><p>Given the fruit is "dark blue"</p><blockquote><p>Next she carried in the jar of dark blue laurel fruit</p></blockquote><p>I believe the Laurel to be similar to an English Laurel/Cherry Laurel or maybe Fruit:</p><img src="/img/english-laurel-fruit.jpeg" height="250px" width="250px" /><p>This is a problem though, because as you can see from this picture, the wild english Laurel looks nothing like it:</p><img src="/img/english-laurel.jpeg" height="250px" width="250px" /><p>I think it's fair to say that neither the Sword Tree or the Cthaeh's tree
<em>looks</em> like a Cherry Laurel tree. But chime in if you see something i don't.
Which is leaving me in a tight spot. Did Rothfuss not check the picture? I doubt it. A tree being a metaphor for
another tree is really odd. Maybe Auri is confused?  I mean, argue
she wouldn't screw up the bone earlier because she attended the university, so now i'm in a bit of a tight spot.
But maybe the pine cones she picks up are from the tree?</p><blockquote><p>Auri found the place while picking pine cones</p></blockquote><p>Maybe the fruit is from the Ivy? Does any Ivy have fruit?</p><p>Well, Hedera <em>Helix</em> or Common Ivy  has a dark blue fruit:</p><img src="/img/Hedera_helix1.jpeg" height="300px" width="300px" /><p>Helix, if you didn't notice from my bold bolding. Is very close to Haliax. Which,
if that's somehow serving as a metaphor for Helix, would be hypocrisy at its best given</p><blockquote><p>“No,” said Lanre. He stood to his full height, his face regal behind the lines
of grief. “There is nothing sweet. I will sow salt, lest the bitter weeds
grow.”</p></blockquote><p>Though, i must mention "a weed" is any plant "you" choose. This would mean our tree is what? A Pine Tree? Is now a good time
to speculate on why Auri and Elodin both want pinecones (even in jest)?</p><p>Finally, Threpe brings up Laurels in a way that suggests Kvothe is the Laurel fruit:</p><blockquote><p>He shrugged. “You see, a laurel needs rain to grow. I can’t do much about that. But I can keep that rain off a few musician’s heads, can’t I?” A sly smile wound its way onto his face. “So God will tend the laurels and keep them wet. And I will tend the players and keep them dry. And wiser minds than mine will decide when to bring the two together.”</p></blockquote><h2 id="lanre">Lanre</h2><p>If Savien is Lanre. Then there is a kvothe thinks Savien is like an oak</p><blockquote><p>And we sang! Her voice like burning silver, my voice an echoing answer. Savien sang solid, powerful lines, like branches of a rock-old oak, all the while Aloine was like a nightingale, moving in darting circles around the proud limbs of it.</p></blockquote><p>Which Makes Aloine the Nightingale in "Swineherd and the Nightingale".</p><h2 id="latantha">Latantha</h2><p>The "Sword Tree" would fit Lanre, given he was known for his strength of Arm. And his sword never left his side.</p><h2 id="conclusions">Conclusions</h2><p>I won't bother scoring, between The Sword Tree and The Cthaeh's Tree. I feel it's
fairly even. In the end they could all be the same tree or the graveyard could
be something we haven't seen. Let me know what you find.</p>
