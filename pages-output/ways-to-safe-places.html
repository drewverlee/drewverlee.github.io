     <img src="/img/waystone-house.jpg" align="right" height="800px" width="200px" /><p>The theory is that Auri can use Greystones to travel and she does so in the SROST
to visit the Mauthen farm. Comparing the Mauthen farm to the location she visits is covered <a href="/pages-output/how-to-get-to-newarre">How to
get to Newarre</a> and what she does there
is covered in <a href="/pages-output/warrens">Warren Widdershins Ways and
Woes</a>.</p><p>Here we will just be discussing Greystones. First will quickly cover that Auri
could use one to visit the Mauthen farm quickly (in mortal time), and then will
discuss the larger topic of Greystones in general. If this seems backwards to
you, then by all means do them in reverse.</p><h2 id="auri-goes-to-mauthen-farm">Auri goes to Mauthen farm</h2><p>Concisely, Auri would have taken the Greystone near the Omethi bridge, traveled
through the Fae, and come out the waystone/door-post*1 around 2 miles north east of Trebon, near
the Mauthen farm. Likely the journey took under an hour from when she leaves the
Underthing tell when she ends up in the Mauthen Farm. I don't think we can
figure out how much distance or time she had to cover in the Fae.</p><p>Auri would have taken the Greystone that Kvothe, Wil and Sim use as a place to
sober up at, on there way back from Imre to the University, right before the
bridge. MWF:36:272</p><blockquote><p>Simmon and I muffled our laughter, and Wilem led us through the trees to a little clearing not fifty
feet from the foot of the bridge. To my surprise a tall greystone stood at the middle of it, pointing
skyward.</p></blockquote><p>From there, she would travel through the Fae, where time moves slower, and come out at the Greystone Kvothe
and Denna dramatically use to take shelter from the draccus. NOTW:74:569:</p><blockquote><p>I grabbed hold of her arm and ran toward the opposite side of the hill. Denna kept up with me at first, then planted her feet when she saw where I was headed. “Don’t be stupid,” she hissed. “We’ll break our necks if we run down that in the dark.” She cast around wildly, then looked up at the nearby greystones. “Get me up there and I’ll haul you up after.”</p></blockquote><img src="/img/draccus-stone.png" height="300px" width="500px" /><p>Clever Pat even calls this chapter "Waystone". Coming out of this Greystone it
would be a short trip for Auri to get the Mauthen farm. Which she describes as a
Graveyrad in SROST.</p><p>Lets cover a similar example of using the Greystones for travel, when Kvothe visits Felurian and enters and leaves the Fae.</p><h2 id="there-and-back-again">there and back again</h2><p>We have first hand experience that the Greystones are indeed used as gateways
between the fae and the mortal realm. When Kvothe follows Felurian past one on
his way into the Fae. WMF:99:633:</p><blockquote><p>Felurian ahead of me. Into the scrub. I dimly remember trees, the smell of earth, the grey of
moonlit stone. She laughs. She dodges, dances, pulls ahead.</p></blockquote><p>Where they both make a bit of music, and at the <em>very</em> least 3 weeks later, he exists, in a different place:</p><blockquote><p>She led me through the forest for hours until we came to a pair of tall greystones. She drew up the
hood of my shaed and bid me close my eyes. Then she led me in a brief circle and I felt a subtle
change in the air. When I opened my eyes I could tell this forest was not the same one I had been
walking through a moment before. The strange tension in the air was gone. This was the mortal
world.</p></blockquote><p>I say <em>at least 3 weeks</em>, based on the changes in his beard that Dedan notes when they meet again.
WMF:107:700:</p><blockquote><p>Before I could say anything Dedan burst in. “What about his beard then? When he ran off three
nights ago his face was smooth as a baby’s ass.”</p></blockquote><p>Anything worthy of even remotely calling a "beard" would take 2 weeks, more
typically 2-4 months. I suspect much Kvothe stayed much longer, but even this
modest guess makes Auri's trip plausible.</p><p>We also have visual confirmation that Auri has visited the fae before:</p><img src="/img/auridance.jpg" height="500px" width="350px" /><p>Finally, I suspect the traveling via the way stones is why Auri is able to have surprisingly fresh lettuce:</p><blockquote><p>The head of lettuce was surprisingly fresh, and I wondered where she had found it.</p></blockquote><h2 id="end">end</h2><p>Thanks for reading!</p><p>The sections below are a work in progress.</p><h2 id="greystones--wip">Greystones  (WIP)</h2><p>I'm trying to map and categorize the Greystones.</p><p>Will use a table and some narrative to better our understanding of waystones. First we have to choose what to categorize:</p><ul><li>Where: so we have some idea how can get around. TODO map</li><li>Standing vs Laying: TODO</li><li>Type: greystone, drawstone, etc...</li><li>old road: because ardlins song mentions it</li><li>The last category will be "Rawness" because bast says he prefers these places. (this was mattys good idea)</li></ul><p>Bast explaining:</p><blockquote><p>“Most of the Fae don’t come to this
world. They don’t like it. It rubs all rough against them, like wearing a burlap
shirt. But when they do come, they like some places better than others. They
like wild places. Secret places. Strange places. There are many types of fae,
many courts and houses. And all of them are ruled according to their own desires
…” Bast continued in a tone of soft conspiracy. “But something that appeals to
all the fae are places with connections</p><p>to the raw, true things that shape the world. Places that are touched with
fire and stone. Places that are close to water and air. When all four come
together …”</p></blockquote><p>So here is our table:</p><table><thead><tr><th align="left">Where</th><th align="left">Standing/laying</th><th align="left">High/low</th><th align="left">Type</th><th align="left">Rawness</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="left">Newarre</td><td align="left">Titled</td><td align="left">Low</td><td align="left">Greystone</td><td align="left">TODO</td></tr><tr><td align="left">Trope Stop</td><td align="left">Standing</td><td align="left">Level</td><td align="left">TODO</td><td align="left">TODO</td></tr><tr><td align="left">Post Trope Death</td><td align="left">Laying</td><td align="left">Level</td><td align="left">TODO</td><td align="left">TODO</td></tr></tbody></table><img src="/img/ruins.jpg" height="200px" width="200px" /><p>For another take on waystones I suggest everything by mattytangle. Though, you should try your hand at it first before consulting his works</p><h2 id="rights">rights</h2><p>pictures are all property of world builders</p><h2 id="quotes">quotes</h2><ol><li>The book simmon reads suggests waystones lead to the fae. It makes particular note of a 3 stones that create a doorway.</li></ol><blockquote><p>“. . . a pair of matched stone monoliths with a third across the top,” Simmon read. “The locals refer
to it as the door-post. While spring and summer pageants involve decorating and dancing around the
stone, parents forbid their children from spending time near it when the moon is full. One wellrespected and otherwise reasonable old man claimed . . .”
Sim broke off reading. “Whatever,” he said disgustedly and moved to close the book.
“Claimed what?” Wilem asked, his curiosity piqued.
Simmon rolled his eyes and continued reading, “Claimed at certain times men could pass through
the stone door into the fair land where Felurian herself abides, loving and destroying men with her
embrace.”</p><p>-- TWMF::292</p></blockquote><p>Which is exactly the type of waystone  we see at near the Mauthen Farm:</p><blockquote><p>The only thing on the top of the hill was a handful of greystones. Three of the massive stones were stacked together to form a huge arch, like a massive doorway. The other two lay on their sides, as if lounging in the thick grass. I found their presence comforting, like the unexpected company of old friends.</p><p>-- NOTW</p></blockquote>
